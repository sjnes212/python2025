#Print the range of numbers from 0 to 19 that are multiples of 3 using a for loop

for x in range(20):
    # it gives the numbers from 0 to 19
    if x%3 == 0:
    # if x is a multiple of 3 or x is divisible by 3, if it returns 0 remainder true print x    
        print(x)

# Output:
# 0 
# 3
# 6 
# 9
# 12
# 15
# 18
